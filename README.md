# Pure360

A simple email client fetching and displaying emails from a simple endpoint.

Made with ReactJS and React Router (love it), conveniently bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and styles with plain old Bootstrap CSS.

Not bad for a first effort, obviously need to work a lot more on the tests and adopt SASS.

## Installation

Run:

    npm install

And then execute:

    npm start

To run the (few) tests:

    npm test
